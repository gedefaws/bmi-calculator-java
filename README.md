# BMI Calculator (Java version)
* Calculates [BMI](https://www.thecalculatorsite.com/articles/health/bmi-formula-for-bmi-calculations.php) of user to know his/her current body weight
* This program will use both Metric (kg/m) and Imperial (lb/in) BMI formula 
* After getting the results, user will know his/her BMI category (underweight, obese, overweight or normal)
* To determine which BMI category is the user, metric units will be used instead of imperial units
* However, imperial units version of the result will still be shown as per reference of user and comparison
* Also demonstrates the usage of Scanner, Conditional Statements, Number Formatting and Methods in Java
* Actiivity is part of my challenge to a [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/android-app-development-with-java) for Android development
* Created to simply practice coding in Java
